### 2. How to merge the branch
There are two branches available which is main and development branch. Main branch only consists of all the tested code that able to work properly and correctly. Development branch is a copy of main branch. Therefore, every time when you want to create a new branch, please create a sub branch from main and working on it. After you have fully tested it, please push to development branch and check whether there is any conflict or not. If don't have conflict, then you can merge with development branch and merge it.
